# TODO

- [ ] how do we deal with timestamps in generel?
- [ ] shouldn't the time window start timestamp also be as close to a phase transition as possible? can we somehow use an old isr timestamp for this?

notes from reading the pdf
- [ ] the repeated varaible check only needs to check for phase transitions and the timsatmp
- [ ] enable compiler optimizations.
- [x] functions that are called by the isr should be static inline. **the compiler optimizations need to be enabled for this (they are currently not enabled!).**
- [ ] **code zum messen von zeitverhalten, generell alles bezüglich zeitverhalten**
- [ ] **tests**
- [ ] **bis mittwoch abend: modulkonzept, ansatz zur bestimmung der maximalen winkelgeschwindigkeit**
- [ ]
